## üéØ Purpose of This Repository

The `.github` repository is a special GitHub feature that helps standardize interactions across all [Ultralytics projects](https://github.com/ultralytics) and the broader [GitHub community](https://github.community/). It contains essential resources such as:

-   **[GitHub Actions Workflows](https://github.com/features/actions)**: Automated sequences that enhance our development and deployment cycles. These workflows improve efficiency and ensure consistent quality, as discussed in posts on the [Ultralytics blog](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/from-algorithms-to-automation-ais-role-in-robotics).
-   **[Issue Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/configuring-issue-templates-for-your-repository)**: Structured templates designed to improve the clarity and completeness of issue reports. This facilitates better communication and faster resolution for bugs, suggestions, or feature requests related to models like [Ultralytics YOLO](https://docs.ultralytics.com/models/).
-   **[Pull Request Templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-template-for-your-repository)**: Templates to guide contributors in creating detailed and meaningful pull requests, ensuring all necessary information is included for review.
-   **Contributing Guidelines**: The foundation of our collaboration strategy. These guidelines outline how to contribute effectively, aligning with our processes, boosting productivity, and maintaining high-quality standards. Find detailed guidance in our [contribution documentation](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/contributing/).

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use These Resources

-   **For Ultralytics Team Members**: Utilize these templates and workflows as defaults for new repositories or when updating existing ones.

-   **For Community Contributors**: If you plan to contribute, please review the provided guidelines and use the templates. This helps us manage contributions efficiently and integrate your valuable changes more quickly. Familiarity with [Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) is also beneficial.
