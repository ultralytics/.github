At [Ultralytics](https://ultralytics.com), the security of our users' data and systems is of utmost importance. To ensure the safety and security of our [open-source projects](https://github.com/ultralytics), we have implemented several measures to detect and prevent security vulnerabilities.

## Snyk Scanning

We use [Snyk](https://snyk.io/advisor/python/ultralytics) to regularly scan our repositories for vulnerabilities and security issues. Our goal is to identify and remediate any potential threats as soon as possible, to minimize any risks to our users.

## GitHub CodeQL Scanning

In addition to our Snyk scans, we also use GitHub's [CodeQL](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/about-code-scanning-with-codeql) scans to proactively identify and address security vulnerabilities.

## Reporting Security Issues

If you suspect or discover a security vulnerability in an Ultralytics repository, please let us know immediately. You can reach out to us directly via our [contact form](https://ultralytics.com/contact) or via [security@ultralytics.com](mailto:security@ultralytics.com). Our security team will investigate and respond as soon as possible.

We appreciate your help in keeping Ultralytics open-source repositories secure and safe for everyone.
