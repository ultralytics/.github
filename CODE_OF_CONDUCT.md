# Ultralytics Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## ü§ù Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone. This applies regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socioeconomic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation. Building an inclusive environment is crucial for fostering innovation in fields like [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/artificial-intelligence-ai) and [computer vision (CV)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/computer-vision-cv).

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community. We encourage you to review the [Ultralytics Contributing Guidelines](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/contributing/) for more details on how to get involved and contribute to projects like [Ultralytics YOLO](https://www.ultralytics.com/yolo). Understanding [AI ethics](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/ai-ethics) is also a key part of responsible contribution to the [Ultralytics ecosystem](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics). Explore our main documentation at [https://docs.ultralytics.com/](https://docs.ultralytics.com/).

## ‚úÖ Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment for our community include:

- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people.
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences, which is vital in collaborative [machine learning (ML)](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/machine-learning-ml) development.
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback, a cornerstone of open-source culture, as highlighted by resources like the [Open Source Guide](https://opensource.guide/code-of-conduct/).
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience. This promotes growth and accountability within the community.
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community, aligning with principles seen in successful open-source projects.

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind.
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks.
- Public or private harassment. Resources like [Project Include](https://projectinclude.org/) offer guidance on preventing such behaviors.
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission. This violates fundamental [data privacy](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/data-privacy) principles.
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting, similar to standards upheld by organizations like the [Python Software Foundation](https://policies.python.org/python.org/code-of-conduct/).

## üõ°Ô∏è Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior. They will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful. Maintaining a respectful environment is essential for productive discussions around topics like [model deployment](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/model-deployment), exploring [AI solutions](https://www.ultralytics.com/solutions), or creating [datasets](https://docs.ultralytics.com/datasets/).

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct. They will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate, ensuring [transparency in AI](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/transparency-in-ai) community management. For further assistance, users can visit the [Ultralytics Help](https://docs.ultralytics.com/help/) section or consult the [Ultralytics Glossary](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary) for definitions.

## üåê Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, such as Ultralytics [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/ultralytics/ultralytics/issues) and [Discussions](https://github.com/orgs/ultralytics/discussions), and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account (like sharing updates from the [Ultralytics Blog](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog)), or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event, similar to the scope defined by the [W3C Code of Ethics](https://www.w3.org/policies/code-of-conduct/).

## ‚öñÔ∏è Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement by contacting the [Ultralytics Support](https://www.ultralytics.com/support) team at `support@ultralytics.com`. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. Addressing issues like [algorithmic bias](https://www.ultralytics.com/glossary/algorithmic-bias) often starts with open and respectful reporting channels.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident. Confidentiality is key to encouraging reports and maintaining trust.

## üìú Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community. This could hinder collaboration on tools like [Ultralytics HUB](https://www.ultralytics.com/hub).

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban. Guidance from resources like [CommunityRule](https://communityrule.info/) can help structure these processes.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior. This can negatively impact the community's ability to achieve goals like advancing [state-of-the-art AI](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/ultralytics-yolo-advancements-in-state-of-the-art-vision-ai).

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals. Promoting [diversity and inclusion](https://www.ultralytics.com/blog/why-empowering-women-in-ai-data-science-is-important) is paramount.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.
